## "there are plenty of fish in the sea; drown yourself in the endless waters!"
*"never be alone again"*

in all seriousness, the following is how to set this project up (just incase i see this years later)

make sure Cargo.toml file is the following:
```

[[bin]]
name = "daemon"
path = "main.rs"

[package]
name = "web_server"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]

```

use the `cargo run` func in terminal to setup localhost 

visit [127.0.0.1:9999](http://127.0.0.1:9999) in the browser ðŸ˜±
or, alternatively, you can visit the github pages version [here](https://superkidsyuvan.github.io/shark-tank)!

...or also use the [self-hosted version](http://) (the district keeps blocking things ðŸ˜«) (Very WIP)

shark tank *"exists"*

will be updated **(frequently)**
